This folder gather the work on the new dataset.

=> Things to know :

All data used are downloadble through the Formated Datas.zip on github. 

-The seedNamePF0XXXX are file that contains the name of the family's proteines. It is used for the result processing.
-The allseqNamePF0XXXX are file that contains the name of the query proteines of the specified family. (not used in this case)

-The folders seedPF0XXXX contains all the sequence of the specified family.
-The folders allseqPF0XXXX contains all the query sequence related to the specified family

-The allseqName is a file that contain the name of all query proteines.
-The allseq folder is a folder that contain the sequence of all the query proteins

-The exploitResult software isn't optimised, and is very slow, even though it can be easily optimised to be fast. (I will optimise it soon)


=> How to use the MinHash program on the new dataset :

Goal : compare query sequence and seed sequence. We want that the query sequence of a specified family match the seed sequence of the same family while query sequences that aren't in the family doesn't match. 

In the exemple, we compare all the sequence we have, with the PF0457 family.

 1) open the minHashNewData, and line 38 write the path of the Seedfamily folder to test. line 39, write the path of the query folder (that contain the sequence to test).
	Exemple : If i want to test the PF06777 family with all the query sequences :
	  Line 38 : std::unordered_map<std::string,std::set<std::uint32_t> > shinglesTrain = shingling_documents("./split/seed/seedPF04857/");
	  line 39 : std::unordered_map<std::string,std::set<std::uint32_t> > shinglesTest = shingling_documents("./split/test/allseq/");


 2) adjust the parameters, line 27,28,29 for the wanted test.

 3) compile and run while redirecting the output in a file (make sure you have the CRC.h in your folder for the compilation).
	exemple :
	 compile : g++ -o output ./minHashNewData.cpp
	 execute : ./output > result.txt

 4) Open exploitResult.sh
	- Line 3, write the path of the seedNamePF0XXXX tested (if i follow my exemple, it would be : ./path/seedNamePF04857)
	- Line 4, write the path of the allseqName, it should contain the name of the query proteine of the specified family tested (in the same exemple : ./path/allseqNamePF04857)
	- Line 5, write the path of the MinHashNewData result.txt file path. (exemple : ./result.txt)

 5) Execute while redirect the output :
	./exploitResults > exploitedResults.txt


In the exploitedResults, there is everything to know on the analyse test
