these two scripts are used for the all to all comparaison of a fastas list to pssm models.

###############################

The first bash script (script_update_concatenation.sh) is used for the concatenation of fastas file, to pepare the comparaison

The first argument -l must be the file that contain all the name of the fastas files to concatenate line by line.
the second argument -f must be the folder that contain all the separated fastas file to concatenate.
The third argument -o  it specifies the output file, the output name should not already exist.
The fourth argument -c specifie at which column should the script read the fastas name in the fastas file (if the document isn't well formated, you can try to input 0 ). 

Typical usage of the script :
./script_name.sh -l list/test_dataset.list_superfamily -f fastas -o output_file.txt -c 1



###############################

This second bash script is used for the comparaison all to all of a concatenation of fastas file with a pssm folder.
It first format the concatenation of the fastas file to allow the comparaison, then it compares.

The first argument -i must be the concatenation of fastas.
the second argument -p must be the folder that contain all the pssm models. 
The third argument -o specifies the output file, the output name should not already exist.
The fourth argument -f specifie the output format. 

Typical usage of the script :
./comparaison.sh -i concat_fasta -p pssmModels -o all_to_all_comparaison -f 6
